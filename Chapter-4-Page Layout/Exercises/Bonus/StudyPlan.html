<!--
    Imagine you have been employed to build a single-page web application 
    that manages a study plan for the Web Development module on the Creative Computing course. 
    Use HTML and CSS to mock-up what this application would look like, without adding any interactivity. 
    You must include:

- Wireframe (add image to the directory);
- Header, Navigation menu, main content and a footer;
- The main content must be split into two or three columns;
- Five demo items;
- Your HTML should use semantically correct elements;
- An external style.css file;
- The use of at least one button;
- The page does not need to be interactive;
- You should focus on the structure and visual layout of the page, but also consider design too;
- Commenting throughout.
